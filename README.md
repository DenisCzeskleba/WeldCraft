# v0.1 - alpha

This is an early, work-in-progress release. It’s meant to get started and provide a basic framework, but it’s not feature-complete, and the code is subject to change. The structure and comments are minimal, and functionality will be updated regularly. Use at your own risk. 

Until Q3 of 2025, this project will see constant updates, either here or on my local machine. Version 1.0 is expected by the end of August 2025.
