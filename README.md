# v0.3.0 - alpha

CURRENT STATE (Jan 2026): Total script re-up from local back-up due to messing up with github.

This is a, work-in-progress release. It’s meant to get started and provide a basic framework, but it’s not feature-complete, and the code is subject to change. The structure and comments are minimal, and functionality will be updated regularly. Use at your own risk. 

Until at least Q2 of 2026, this project will see constant updates, either here or on my local machine. Version 1.0 is expected by the end of Q2 2026.
